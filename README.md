# Durell Smiley's Portfolio

## About Me 

Hello world! My name is Durell Smiley and i'm a senior DCD major at Coastal Carolina University. I am currently planning on graduating in the Fall semester and hope to get a job in my field soon after. I'm interested in advertising, coding and social media branding so hopefully i can find a job relating to that in the future. My interests outside of DCD include playing video games, collecting shoes, and playing with my dog.

## About My Future

My career aspirations are pretty varied because i'm such an open minded person and am open to many new things. While I don't have a specific job that i'm currently looking for, I'd be happy to at least get a job close to my field. I currently work at Walmart and thats nowhere close to anything related to DCD so my mindset regarding that is its only up from here. My current hope is that whatever internship I land, I end up liking it and hopefully get a position with them so fingers crossed.

## About My Aesthetic

Lastly my aesthetic is something that changes almost every given year whether it be my clothes or the way my room looks, the aesthetic is evolving. My current aesthetic is minimalistic but still vibrant in different aspects. When it comes to clothes it just comes down to oversized t-shirts and shorts short enough to possibly be a problem depending on how I move. When it comes down to technology and things in that aspect, i've grown to love the simplicity of Apple and how all their products weave together so seemlessly, I was into Android when I was younger but as I grew in age all the customization just became overwhelming. Lastly for my design aesthetic i'd say its still pretty simple, I usually gravitate more towards designs with fewer colors and not much going on.

# Vector Images
![My first vector image I made. It might look a little weird but I like the contrast it has from the original image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58044396/116488669-e78c7200-a860-11eb-8b76-07ea11c12db1.jpg)

This was my first vector image I ever made and while it does look pretty weird I do like how it looks compared to the original because it's like an opposite weirder take on the original picture.

This is the original picture to compare between the two

##  Artist Statement

Over the course of this class, I've really been looking for things that define what my design aesthetic truly is and while most things we've done in this class have been completely new to me, over the course of things I finally figured out what I gravitated more while doing things with design. This entire time I've been saying that my aesthetic is simple with elements that standout but in reality, my aesthetic is an everchanging thing that is different depending on how I feel that day to be completely honest. Some days when I have a lot of energy and I'm feeling good about the day I feel like my aesthetic is more abstract while on a lowkey kind of day my aesthetic turns into something more boring and darker in color. Once coming to that conclusion, I knew deep down inside that my aesthetic wasn’t really that good so when deciding on things to be used for this portfolio I leaned toward more of the editing and animation I did instead of the other designs. With that being said I decided to use my edited vacation videos and the motion video I made. I like looking at my vacation videos because (to me) it’s crazy that my iPhone 8 took those pictures and it really makes you appreciate things like that because I thought since my phone was so old at the time, that It could never take a picture that good, but It proved me wrong. For the motion video, the entire inspiration was based off a very old meme so adding my dog to it was only right.
