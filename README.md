## Durell Smiley's Portfolio

# About Me 

Hello world! My name is Durell Smiley and i'm a senior DCD major at Coastal Carolina University. I am currently planning on graduating in the Fall semester and hope to get a job in my field soon after. I'm interested in advertising, coding and social media branding so hopefully i can find a job relating to that in the future. My interests outside of DCD include playing video games, collecting shoes, and playing with my dog.

# About My Future

My career aspirations are pretty varied because i'm such an open minded person and am open to many new things. While I don't have a specific job that i'm currently looking for, I'd be happy to at least get a job close to my field. I currently work at Walmart and thats nowhere close to anything related to DCD so my mindset regarding that is its only up from here. My current hope is that whatever internship I land, I end up liking it and hopefully get a position with them so fingers crossed.

# About My Aesthetic

Lastly my aesthetic is something that changes almost every given year whether it be my clothes or the way my room looks, the aesthetic is evolving. My current aesthetic is minimalistic but still vibrant in different aspects. When it comes to clothes it just comes down to oversized t-shirts and shorts short enough to possibly be a problem depending on how I move. When it comes down to technology and things in that aspect, i've grown to love the simplicity of Apple and how all their products weave together so seemlessly, I was into Android when I was younger but as I grew in age all the customization just became overwhelming. Lastly for my design aesthetic i'd say its still pretty simple, I usually gravitate more towards designs with fewer colors and not much going on.
