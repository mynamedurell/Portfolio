Hello world! My name is Durell Smiley and i'm a senior DCD major at Coastal Carolina University.

I'm interested in advertising, coding and social media branding so hopefully i can find a job relating to that in the future. My interests outside of DCD include playing video games, collecting shoes, and playing with my dog.
